Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I did not overload any methods because I could not get my code to correctly exeute but I will ovelroad and rodo this part of the reflection when I do get there. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment was more difficult for me and I think this was becuase it combined a lot of the different elements that we have been working on in class. I found that going back into past assingemtns was helpful however, I still got stuck and need to get a little more support. I therefore would advise going back into past assignments and also getting help when needed.
