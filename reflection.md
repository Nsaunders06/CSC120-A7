Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I did not overload any methods because I could not get my code to correctly exeute but I will ovelroad and rodo this part of the reflection when I do get there. 

I overloaded the house constructor to only have a name and an elevator because if someone needed accessibility resources then they would need to be able to quickly atttain a list of house names, adress and elevator status as the other things would be less important. This also would be helpful if you did not know a lot about a house as all of this information could be easily attained through the Smith website. There is also an even simplier house contstructor with just house name and adress which would be helpful if you really only knew basic information about the house. The second overloaded one is the library name with the collection. This would be helpful is you just wanted to be able to implement a library and with a specfic book/collection in it. 

In the library class I overloaded the constructor twice. The first one is the most basic information about the library which is the name and the adress. This could be helpful if one were to simply just want to know where  any library was. The next one just has the library name, adress and the number of floors which would be helpful if you did not know or care if the library had a elevator. 

For the cafe class I first overloaded the constructor by creating a much simplier version that just included a name and address which would be helpful if you didn't know a lot about a cafe. I then created a constructor with just the name address and the information about a restock which could be used to create a cafe that only cared about the quantities it had in stock. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment was more difficult for me and I think this was becuase it combined a lot of the different elements that we have been working on in class. I found that going back into past assingemtns was helpful however, I still got stuck and need to get a little more support. I therefore would advise going back into past assignments and also getting help when needed.
